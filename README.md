# KSPStock_RSSPrincipiaSSOCalculator

This tool can generate configuration file of Principia, so as to add the second-order spherical harmonic coefficient j2 to the stock planet to help players successfully enter the sun-synchronous orbit of the stock planet. At the same time, this tool also supports the calculation of relevant parameters of the sun-synchronous orbit in the RealSolarSystem environment.Â 

<h2> Dependencies </h2>

1. The newly generated `StockPlanet_GravityModels.cfg` file requires support from [Kopernicus](https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus).
2. The game environment ***must*** have support from [Principia](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/162200-wip181-191-1101-1110%E2%80%932-1122%E2%80%935-principia%E2%80%94version-%E4%BC%8A%E8%97%A4-released-2023-06-18%E2%80%94n-body-and-extended-body-gravitation/).
